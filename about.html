		<h3 style="text-decoration:underline;text-transform:uppercase;"><strong>The Boring Stuff</strong></h3>
		<p>When it comes to writing about myself, I tend to struggle so I will try my best but as you can see from the <strong>Quick Stats,</strong> My name is Ryan Elliott, I'm 25 years old and currently have over 4 years coding experience.
	    To find out what languages I have experience in, just keep reading and scrolling.
	 </p>
	 <h3 style="text-decoration:underline;text-transform:uppercase;"><strong>Playing The Sympathy Card</strong></h3>
	 <p>Due to personal issues at home and school, I left at 14 years old and had to go and live with my dad. However, he was not able to get me into another school which meant I was free to go along with him to work and not look back.</p>

	<p>This of course had a huge impact on my future which at the time I didn't give much thought to. So as a result, I struggled to achieve the many things everyone else around me had or were achieving everyday. This unfortunately also had an impact on my mental health. I began to get depressed and started to wonder if I'd ever get anywhere and wished I could go back and fight through the problems I had in order to put me in a position to get to where I wanted to be.</p>

	<h3 style="text-decoration:underline;text-transform:uppercase;"><strong>Let Us Not Dwell On The Past</strong></h3>
	 <p>I could have gone on forever about how bad life choices have put me in the position I am in today but dwelling on the past will get you nowhere and will stop you from trying to improve your future.</p>

	 <p>At a certain point when I was 16, I realized that I really needed to sort my life out and ensure I have a bright future for not only myself but my future family.</p>

	<p>This however wasn't very easy as getting a job and working for someone else was not on the agenda as I wanted to work for myself and not have someone else shouting down my ear. So I went to work and tried to think of a way I could make myself some money. After a year or so I thought of something. A <strong>Website.</strong> Yes I wanted to give it a go as gaining the knowledge needed to do such a thing was something I wanted growing up. So I started to look into how you create a website, which began with knowing what I'd need to learn about web development.</p>

	<p>Not wanting to push myself too far, I decided HTML and CSS would be the way to go. So after a lot of research, help and experimenting, I made my very first website from pure <strong>HTML</strong> & <strong>CSS!</strong> But I had a problem, no money to actually publish the website so unfortunately it didn't make it online, however I achieved something I never thought I would.</p>

	<p>Fast forward another year or so and after a few other failed attempts of making something of myself, I wanted to learn how to develop <strong>Android</strong> APPS. This was something I attempted a few times but I only got as far as downloading and installing Eclipse because as soon as I was about to start making my first app, I chickened out and gave up instantly. However I didn't give up for long because one day I said to myself <strong><em>"Right, I really want to give it a proper go!"</em></strong> so I came up with a game plan.</p>

	<p>I knew that just downloading the needed software and just going into it was never going to work so I figured the best approach was to think of an app I wanted to make and just make it, no matter how hard it may be. So I did. By the end it meant I had managed to teach myself <strong>HTML, CSS</strong> and now <strong>Java</strong>.</p>
	<p>I'm going to leave this section here now as what you've already read has hardly scratched the surface! So Providing I haven't bored you too much, please carry on reading through until the end of the page where you can find more information on my coding history and details of the many <strong>Android</strong> apps I have created along with my second <strong>Website</strong>.</p>

			<h1 class="text-center">What made me get started?</h1>
		<hr>
		<p>As far as I can remember I have adored technology, especially when it comes to the way it works but mainly when it comes to how websites and mobile apps are created! I used to think I'd need to be some scientific genius to create such things so for a long time I just appreciated the work that was put in and the knowledge the developers have.</p>

		<p>Until One day I decided I wanted to give it a go, which if you've gotten this far, you'll know that I took the big step and started involving myself in the developing world. First with a <strong>Website</strong>, then with an <strong>Android</strong> app.</p>
